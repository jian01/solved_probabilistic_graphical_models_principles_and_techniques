# Solved exercises for "[Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/probabilistic-graphical-models)"

This is an attempt of having fun and learning graphical models.

I would include as little as possible from the exercises original text so it only makes sense if you have the book (probably it is not illegal if i include the complete exercises but i like it this way).

If you see a mistake in any resolution ðŸ™ˆ i would appreciate if you start an issue.
