# Solved "Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques"

This is an attempt of having fun and learning graphical models.

I would include the as little as possible from the exercises text so it only makes sense if you have the book (probably it is not illegal if i include the exercises complete but i like it this way).

If you are seeing this it means i made it public, if you see a mistake in any resolution ðŸ™ˆ i would appreciate you to start an issue.
